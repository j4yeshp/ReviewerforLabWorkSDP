# Anonymous Reviewer for Lab Work SDP

Here, we present a module to introduce Anonymous student peer review of laboratory works to engineering students. The most important part of the module was the classification scheme. In this project students will review lab work of each other anonymously.

Purpose of this project is to reduce the time of reviewing lab work for teachers and revising the study for the students and give the feedback on lab work.  

This project will contains three types of user: Teachers,
Students,
Admin.

Teachers can register in the database, then will be able to login. Teacher will be able to post assignments for students, where students will be able to submit their lab work. Teachers will also be able to post correct answer copy as a referral. Teachers can also review lab work submitted by students.

Students will be registered by admin, then will be able to login. Students can submit their lab work. When all assignments are submitted student will be able to review lab work of one of their classmateâ€™s anonymously. Students will be able to see, compare with referral copy posted by teacher and then review and provide appropriate feedback of lab work.

Admin will be able to manage students and teachers in the system. Admin can register, remove students and teachers in the system. The Role of admin will be assigned to one of the teachers.

Review of lab work will be anonymous for students but the system will keep track of whose lab work is assigned to whom in backend. That way the teacher will be able to see who reviewed lab work and the teacher will be able to make changes in the review.
